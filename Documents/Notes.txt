Introduction to Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) Gaming

Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) gaming has been declining due to outdated technologies. However, those still in operation excel at delivering the classic MUD experience. The advent of generative AI offers a significant opportunity to rejuvenate this gaming genre, though current software does not leverage this technology.
Components of the Aqevia Project

The Aqevia project consists of several key components:

    AqeviaCore: Server application for hosting MUD game worlds.
    AqeviaBuilder: Web client for game world creation and modification.
    AqeviaClient: Web client for end-users to play within the MUD game worlds.
    AqeviaAdmin: Administration panel for managing the server and game worlds.
